        <p>Hello, my name is Avrey Brown, and I'm from Sherman, Texas. I'm straight out of high school, graduated class of 2018, my previous jobs mostly entailed physical labor, so coding is a very new experience for me. I'm mainly here due to my aunt, she is a project manager for Globant, so she paid for me to come here to see if it would interest me as a career option. I'd ideally wish to use coding in the gaming industry or for developing gaming  applications for phones.</p>

        <p>Hello! My name is Chris Cummings and I’m a web developer. Before Code Fellows I was working in GIS for Google Maps and I was a hydrologic technician for the US Geological Survey.  I’ve always had a passion for technology and problem solving in whatever field I was working in, so coding has been a natural fit for me in both regards. I’ve been known to photoshop my coworkers and fellow students into various images.</p>

        <p>My name is David Zheng. I am a web developer at Code Fellows. My background is in sports medicine; I received my bachelor’s degree in athletic training from Michigan State University. I am also a Navy veteran; I was an avionics technician in a F/A-18 fighter jet squadron. Prior to Code Fellows, I worked at a Boeing manufacturing plant as an athletic trainer. I decided to try software development because I want to learn something new and challenging. My interest for coding grew from my love of learning different spoken languages. My past experiences as an athletic trainer can shape me into a better developer because of my passion for helping people.</p>
